# React + Redux :Dating Site

## Objectives

A dating app! Matches users based on how far away they are, so you can be lazy and not have to travel for love.

Uses Rails API backend with React/Redux frontend.

Still to do:

- Should My account/show details page be on a different page?
- Better way of dealing with refreshes?
- After add user, user is logged in automatically but takes a long time
1. Be able to crop pictures properly using Cloudinary
2. Match users randomly but keep in mind location and maybe age? - Better algorithm overall
3. Match multiple genders
5. Tests
7. Get rid of Textinput file.
- In new user form placeholder should go away on typing

DONE
- If logged in should only show you your matches. Currently shows you everyone - done
- If logged in - show details should be my account button, should show that information, allow edits
- NEXT - Refresh seems to log you out? Although token is still in localStorage
